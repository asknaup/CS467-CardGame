      <h2>Rule Sets</h2>
      <h3>Rule Set 1: Creatures and Spells</h3>
      <h4>Creatures</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Each player can have a maximum of 5 creatures on the battlefield at any given time.</li>
        <li>Creatures have Attack and Defense values, representing their offensive and defensive capabilities.</li>
        <li>Creatures may have special abilities or effects that trigger under certain conditions.</li>
        <li>Players can summon creatures by paying the required mana cost, which is indicated on the card.</li>
        <li>Creatures can attack the opponent directly or other creatures controlled by the opponent.</li>
        <li>If a creature's defense reaches zero or below, it is destroyed and placed into the graveyard.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Spells</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Spells are magical cards with various effects that can impact the game.</li>
        <li>Spells may include offensive spells that deal damage to creatures or players, 
          defensive spells that protect creatures or players, and utility spells that 
          manipulate the game state.</li>
        <li>Players can cast spells by paying the required mana cost, which is indicated on the card.</li>
        <li>Some spells may have instant effects that resolve immediately upon casting, while others may 
          have ongoing effects that last for a specified duration.</li>
      </ol>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Rule Set 2: Combat Mechanics</h3>
      <h4>Combat Phase</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Each turn consists of a combat phase where players can attack with their creatures.</li>
        <li>During the combat phase, the active player declares their attacking creatures and selects targets for their attacks.</li>
        <li>The defending player can choose to block attacking creatures with their own creatures or allow the attack to go through.</li>
        <li>If a creature is blocked, it deals damage to the blocking creature equal to its attack value, and vice versa.</li>
        <li>If a creature is unblocked, it deals damage to the defending player equal to its attack value.</li>
        <li>Damage dealt to creatures reduces their defense value. If a creature's defense reaches zero or below, it is destroyed 
          and placed into the graveyard.</li>
        <li>After the combat phase, players proceed to the next phase of the turn.</li>
      </ol>
