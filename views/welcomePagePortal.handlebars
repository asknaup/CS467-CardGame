      <h2>Welcome to the Online Trading Card Game Generator</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>Our team was tasked with developing a web-based application thatâ€™ll receive user inputs to create online
        trading card games (TCGs).
        <br><br>
        Users have account-based logins and are presented with a portal upon entry
        showing all of the public TCGs on the site. They'll be able to view and CRUD their own TCG games via a Portal
        menu. Users are capable of editing, publishing or deleting their games, including being able to edit their game
        attributes. <br><br>
        CRUDing for game cards is possible along with uploading images and attribute editing. New decks can
        be created randomly
        and then played according to the rules of the trading card game. Games are ended based on time or when one
        player wins. This web app is opearing on a Node.JS web app server using a MySQL db along with HTML5, CSS and
        JavaScript.
